compGraphics
============

Repository for projects I worked on while in TCNJ's Computer Graphics Course. The PoolBall directory contains my final project for the course. It is a 9-ball simulator.

My final project is pretty cool. It creates a Pool Table and initializes the setup into one typical for a game of 9-ball. Collision resolution is handled by treating each ball-ball collision as perfectly elastic. As I was in Linear Algebra at the time, mathematical techniques for projection were used to rescale each ball's movement vectors and then swap them, resulting in realistic looking collisions. 

<strong>Some work still needs to be done on this project:</strong><br>
I'd like to add:
<ul>
  <li>Game win conditions</li>
  <li>Game loss conditions</li>
  <li>Improved quality textures</li>
  <li>Improved texture mapping for painting striped textures onto rotating spheres (this is an algorithm I am working on in my spare time.)</li>
</ul>
